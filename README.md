# RPS---rock-paper-scissors

## info about the code

1. This is a simple code for that game.
2. there is one code with picturs.
3. you must have the pictures in your file so the code will be able to read the photoes.
4. and them must be on "png", so it will work and not "jpg" format.
5. there are all so icones, to put on the window to decorate it
6. the codes are based on youtube guides for the game' all so the one with out the picture.
7. I workd with TK library for the GUI. it is the basic GUI library in python.

## problems
well in the code with the button hanve one problem.
I could't make a counter in the game, so it will give you the nuber of win and lose.
I succeeded to put it on the window, but it doesn't change the number according to the win and lose.
it sopuosed to work by the ttk library, but I cound't figure it out.

[have fun!!]
